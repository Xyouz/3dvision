# Vision 3D artificielle

This repository contains the code I wrote for the various practical sessions of the 3D vision course given by Pascal Monasse, Mathieu Aubry and Renaud Marlet at MVA.

Most of it is written in C++ and requires the [Imagine++](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/) library to work.
